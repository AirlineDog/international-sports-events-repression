# international-sports-events-repression

### **Overview**

This repository contains Python code that replicates and extends the analysis presented in the research paper "International Sports Events and Repression in Autocracies: Evidence from the 1978 FIFA World Cup" by Scharpf, Gläßel, and Pearce. The original study investigates the relationship between repression in autocratic regimes and international sports events, focusing on the 1978 FIFA World Cup.

### **Data**

The project uses data from the original study, which is available in the `data` directory. The data includes information on repression events, host cities, time periods, and other relevant variables. Sources can be found inside the notebook.
